I am a PhD candidate at Paris School of Economics and Université Paris 1 Panthéon Sorbonne. I work under the supervision of Helene Ollivier and Geoffrey Barrows. 

In the Fall 2024, I am visiting Olivier Deschenes at University of California Santa Barbara. 

My research lies at the intersection of environmental, health and transports economics. Specifically, I use data and econometric methods to study the economic of air pollution. My work seeks to quantify the health and economic costs associated with air pollution and investigate how adaptation and mitigation strategies can help reduce these costs
