I am a PhD candidate at **Paris School of Economics** and **Université Paris 1 Panthéon Sorbonne**. I work under the supervision of Helene Ollivier and Geoffrey Barrows. 

In the Fall 2024, I visited [Olivier Deschenes](https://www.olivierdeschenes.org) at **University of California Santa Barbara**.

My research lies at the intersection of environmental, health and transports economics. Specifically, I use data and econometric methods to study the **economic of air pollution**. My work seeks to quantify the health and economic costs associated with air pollution and investigate how adaptation and mitigation strategies can help reduce these costs.
